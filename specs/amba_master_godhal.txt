Assumptions. The assumptions are as follows.
A1 Length of transfer will be specified with REQ_VLD signal i.e., whenever REQ_VLD is high, one of LEN1, LEN4 and LENX signal shall be high.
A2 Nature of transfer will be specified with REQ_VLD signal i.e., whenever REQ_VLD signal is high, at least one of RD or WR signal shall be high.
A3 If REQ_VLD signal is low, then RD, WR, LEN1, LEN4 and LENX shall hold their values.
A4 There cannot be conflict between signals indicating nature of transfer, thus RD and WR signal cannot be high simultaneously.
A5 There cannot be conflict between signals indicating length of transfer thus LEN1, LEN4 and LENX signals cannot be high simultaneously.
A6 Input HRESP signal shall be OKAY throughout.
A7 The bus is a fair one, hence every HBUSREQ shall eventually be answered.
A8 During a locked unspecified length burst, leaving HBUSREQ high locks the bus.
A9 Eventually, HREADY will be high.
A10 Eventually, REQ_VLD and HGRANT signals will be low.

Guarantees. The guarantees are as follows.
G1 Data bus is 32-bit wide. Thus HSIZE shall be fixed to WORD throughout.
G2 HBUSREQ signal gets asserted and de-asserted with REQ_VLD.
G3 Bus master requests only for locked transfer.
G4 If the ongoing transfer is last transfer of an AHB sequence, then HLOCK shall be lowered.
G5 Length four burst (HBURST = INCR4) shall end at fourth occurrence of HREADY.
G6 HBURST shall be set according to length of the transfer indicated by LEN1, LEN4 and LENX.
G7 First transfer of an AHB sequence is always NONSEQ in nature. All following transfers in sequence shall be SEQ in nature.
G8 Nature of transfer shall be set according to WR and RD signals.
G9 If HREADY is low, then all control signals shall hold their values.
G10 When HREADY and HGRANT are simultaneously high, REQ_ADDR signal shall be high. It ensures that in next cycle, master can put address on address bus.
G11 When both REQ_ADDR and WR signals are high, REQ_WR_DATA signal shall also be high. It ensures that data shall be put on data bus one cycle after address is put on address bus.
G12 When a read transfer is taking place and HREADY is high, REC_RD_DATA signal shall also be high.
G13 When REQ_ADDR is high, the input signals IN_ADDR will be copied to address bus in the next cycle.
G14 When REQ_WR_DATA is high, the input signals IN_DATA will be copied to data bus in the next cycle.
G15 When read transaction is in progress and HREADY is high, OUT_DATA will copy the value of HRDATAin the next cycle.
