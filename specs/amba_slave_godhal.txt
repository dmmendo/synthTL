Assumptions. The assumptions are as follows.
A1 When the slave is not selected by the decoder, all control signals shall be low.
A2 When HTRANS is IDLE, all control signals shall be low.
A3 First transfer of any sequence is NONSEQ in nature.
A4 Non-first transfer of an AHB sequence will always be SEQ in nature.
A5 Burst sequence of length four shall end at fourth occurrence of HREADY.
A6 If this is last transaction of a sequence and next cycle is not start of another sequence, HTRANS shall be IDLE in next cycle.
A7 If HREADY is low, then all control signals, address and data buses shall hold their values.

Guarantees. The guarantees are as follows.
G1 When the slave is not selected by the decoder, HREADY signal shall be high.
G2 When the slave is not selected by the decoder, HRESP shall be OKAY.
G3 When no AHB transaction is taking place, HRESP shall be OKAY.
G4 RD and WR signal cannot be high simultaneously.
G5 If memory is full and write transfer is attempted, then the slave shall send an ERROR response. Similarly, if the memory is empty and a read transfer is attempted, then the slave shall send an ERROR response.
G6 When slave is involved in a transfer, HWRITE is used to decide values of WR and RD.
G7 When slave is involved in any transfer, signal HADDR is used to decide ADDR.
G8 When slave is involved in write transfer, signal HWDATA is used to decide DI.
G9 When slave is involved in read transfer, signal DO is used to decide HRDATA.
